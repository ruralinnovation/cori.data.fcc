<p>NBM was started by the FCC in November 2022<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2022/11/18/new-broadband-maps-are-finally-here" class="external-link"&gt;https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2022/11/18/new-broadband-maps-are-finally-here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> and is following <a href="https://ruralinnovation.github.io/cori.data.fcc/articles/f477.html">Form
477</a>.</p>
<p>Behind the National Broadband Map they are <strong>two</strong>
datasets (see <span class="citation">@fig-broadbanddata</span>, below).
We are using the “Broadband Availability” dataset that is derived from
the “Fabric” locations dataset (developed by CostQuest). The locations
are determined within the Fabric locations data.</p>
<p>This dataset can be derived in multiple ways: by States or by
Providers.</p>
<p>At the States the Data can be split between summaries and “raw data”.
The summaries available are by geographies or by technologies: Fixed
Broadband and Mobile Broadband.</p>
<p>For every states you need to access the raw data by technologies. In
our works we focused in the Fixed Broadband Availability Data.</p>
<p>Here, the NBM provides information at the scale of a “service” - a
location covered by a provider by a technology with specifics maximum
speeds.</p>
<p>This is one of the big change versus Form 477: we are moving from the
scale of a Census block to the scale of a location (See <span class="citation">@sec-BSL</span> for a definition).</p>
<p>Every location is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is providing those services (<code>frn</code>,
<code>provider_id</code>, and <code>brand_name</code>)</li>
<li>A description of each services (<code>technology</code>,
<code>max_advertised_download_speed</code>,
<code>max_advertised_upload_speed</code>, <code>low_latency</code>)</li>
<li>Whether the location associated with residential, business or
both</li>
<li>ways to localize it (<code>state_abbr</code>,
<code>block_geoid</code>, <code>h3_res8_id</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In our ingestion we did not kept <code>h3_res8_id</code> but we added
the date of the release and the timestamp provided in the filename (see
<code>data-raw/NBM.R</code> to get every details).</p>
<p>The exact coordinates of every locations is only part of the Fabric
dataset and within the Broadband Availability we can only link a record
for a location to a Census Block (2020 vintage) or H3 hexagon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A broadband serviceable location is defined as “a business or
residential location in the United States at which fixed broadband
Internet access service is, or can be, installed.” A residential BSL
includes all residential structures, including structures that are (or
contain) housing units or group quarters (as those terms are defined by
the United States Census Bureau).<br>
A business BSL includes “all non-residential (business, government,
non-profit, etc.) structures that are on property without residential
locations and that would expect to demand Internet access service.”

us that sometimes their release can be faster (more than one per week)
or slower. The FCC did not (April 2024) provides a changelog between
releases or versions (but the documentation has some of the major
changes<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;See “Change Log” &lt;a href="https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output" class="external-link"&gt;https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a>).</p>

<p>It will depends on your specific needs. We were more interested at
the information at the census block level but for that we needed to
download the data. So we might as well share how we do it. We then first
transformed the data in our database. The process was taking some time
and frequently we had questions that could not be answered with how the
schema was made, hence we reingested it. Ingesting CSV is a coastly
operation it was better to have an intermediary data set, close to the
raw data but in a better format to either access it and or reingest it.
Parquet was perfect for that need and we might as well provide other to
access it.</p>

## What is unserved v.s. underseved?

Served, Unserved and Underseved are **overlapping** categories at the **location level**. They can be extended at the "**area level**".

If all available internet services at a location have advertised (reported) maximum speeds that are below 25 Mbps downstream speed or below 3 Mbps upstream (25/3 to simplify), then that location is categorized as **unserved**. If a location has at least one service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 25/3, but no service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 100/20, it is categorized as **underserved**. If a location has at least one service with maximum speeds that are equal to or above 100/20, then that location is categorized as **served**.

Those definitions are recommended in the [FCC's Broadband Speed Benchmark](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark) and can be adapted by every States[^pew_list].

[^pew_list]: Page 4 [https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2023/06/un--and-underserved-definitions-ta-memo-pdf.pdf](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2023/06/un--and-underserved-definitions-ta-memo-pdf.pdf)

:::{.aside}
FCC could change those definitions and for example move the bar at 100/20: [https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-increases-broadband-speed-benchmark)
